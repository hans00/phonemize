Use your linguistics expertise to solve problems.
And follow the following rules when modifying G2P:
1. Do not have word lists or special processing in the code, which will destroy the spirit of rule based
2. Rule-based G2P should be common process, never special-case for any word
3. Give me exquisite and useful code, reject high-level garbage
4. Be sure to fully consider the details of pronunciation when modifying
5. Try not to modify the dictionary
6. Don't left useless comment in code
7. After modification, please make sure that you have not damaged the operation of existing functions

Note: For debug rule based G2P should construct with `disableDict: true`
