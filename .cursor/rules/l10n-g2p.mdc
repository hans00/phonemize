Please follow the following rules when modifying G2P:
1. Use `g2pModel.predict('word', undefined, undefined, true)` to bypass dictionary processing for debug
2. Do not have word lists or special processing in the code, which will destroy the spirit of rule based
3. Rule-based G2P should not contain any special processing or word table
4. Give me exquisite and useful code, reject high-level garbage
5. Be sure to fully consider the details of pronunciation when modifying
6. Try not to modify the dictionary
7. After modification, please make sure that you have not damaged the operation of existing functions
